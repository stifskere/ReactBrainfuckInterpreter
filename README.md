# React Brainfuck Interpreter

This is a simple Brainfuck interpreter built with React. It allows you to write and execute Brainfuck programs in your web browser.

## What is Brainfuck?

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It consists of only eight commands, making it one of the simplest programming languages. Despite its simplicity, Brainfuck is Turing-complete, meaning it can compute any computable function.

## Features

- Changeable delay
- Persistent memory
- [Stolen manual](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a)
- Dynamic memory viewer
- BrainFuck generator

## Getting Started

To get started with the Brainfuck interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/stifskere/ReactBrainfuckInterpreter
   ```
   
2. Move the working directory to the project root

    ```shell
    cd react-brainfuck-interpreter
    ```
3. Start the React development server

    ```shell
   npm start
    ```
4. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the Brainfuck interpreter.

## Usage 

Once you have the interpreter up and running, you can start writing and executing Brainfuck programs. Here's a quick overview of the available features:

- **Not that rich of an editor**: it's an HTML input element, nothing else.
- **Run and reset and stop button**: You can obviously run your brainfuck code and reset the memory without losing your changes
- **Input**: The , instruction will spawn a modal, you can input text
- **Output**: The program has an output for the . instruction.
- **Stolen manual**: You can always check reference right next to your program output.
- **Cursor**: When running the program there will be a cursor that shows the instruction being run.
- **BrainFuck generator**: Clicking the output box will open a prompt asking to generate text, [impl](https://github.com/stifskere/ReactBrainfuckInterpreter/blob/e1897819c7a49cc630bee108e48a8a345c3e4ddf/src/Modules/BrainFuckManager.ts#L115) based from [original program made in java](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/5418/brainf-golfer/5440#5440)

Feel free to explore the interface and experiment with different Brainfuck programs!
